### Problem Statement -
With a growing trend towards digitisation and prevalence of mobile phones and internet access, more consumers have an online presence and their opinions hold a good value for any product-based company, especially so for the B2C businesses. The industries are trying to fine-tune their strategies to suit the consumer needs, as the consumers leave some hints of their choices during their online presence. 


Suppose your customer is a mobile manufacturer based in the US, which entered the market three years ago. As they are a new entrant in the sector, they want to understand their competitors and preferences of their users so that they can design their strategies accordingly. They want to tweak the marketing strategies to add more value to their brand, provide features to customers that add the most value, and close the demand-supply gap. Their objective is to increase the market share as well as the brand value.

 

Assume that as a data analytics provider, you have been approached by this mobile phone manufacturer. They want you to provide them with some major insights into the mobile phone industry to help them achieve their objective. Their objective is to develop a new product optimally and create some marketing strategies.
